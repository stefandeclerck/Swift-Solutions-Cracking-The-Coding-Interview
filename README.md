# Welcome to Cracking the Coding Interview in Swift!

As I go through the book Cracking the Coding Interview to prepare myself for upcoming iOS development interviews, for every question I go through I will post my solutions here in Swift (converted from the Java code which is used in the book). 

The goal of this repo is to help demonstrate how the solutions in the book Cracking the Coding Interview are represented using the Swift programming language.

All the code in this repo is compatible with **Swift 3.0** and **Xcode 8.0**. This repository will constantly be updated as I continue through the book :)

**Feel Free to Contribute!!!**
